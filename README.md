# push_swap
A Codam Coding College project made by Saladin Afoh
## Project Goal
Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program using Push_swap instruction language that sorts the integer arguments received.
You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.
## Learning Targets
- Making a comprehensive README.md
- Version control
- Linked lists
- Complexity
- Rigor
## Documentation
- [Instructions](/docs/instructions.md)
- [Game rules](/docs/game_rules.md)
## Usage
Compile the project
```console
make;
```
Recompile the project
```console
make re:	
```
to clean all of the libraries, including libft.
```console
5. make fclean; make fclean DEBUG=1:
```
Prepare and run a debuggable executable
```console
6. make re main; ./push_swap_lldb:
```
